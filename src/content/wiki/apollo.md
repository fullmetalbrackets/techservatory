## Hardware

<br>

##### Dell Optiplex 3050 SFF

- 256 GB NVMe SSD (Boot drive)
- 2 TB 3.5" Internal HDD (media storage)
- 1 TB 2.5" Internal HDD (documents, photos & app data storage)
- 1 TB 2.5" External HDD (back ups of documents, photos & app data)
- 1 Gbps Ethernet

Bought on EBay for around $160. Added a cheap, low capacity NVMe SSD to use as a boot drive, added a 2 TB full-size (2.5") hard drive for large media file storage, and replaced the CD drive with a caddy that holds a laptop hard drive (2.5") where I store documents, photos and app data for the running docker containers. An addional 2.5" laptop hard drive in an external USB 3.0 enclosure provides functions as backup for the documents, photos and container data.
